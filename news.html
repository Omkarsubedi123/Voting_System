                <p class="news-excerpt">Greenwood High celebrated a record-breaking student turnout during its annual student council elections held this Friday. More than 85% of the student body participated in the vote — a historic milestone in the school’s democratic history. Principal Laura James credited the increase to this year’s digital voting system and the enthusiastic campaigning of all candidates. “The energy this year was electric,” she said. The senior class presidency was won by Jasmine Lee, who emphasized mental health and academic flexibility in her campaign. “I want students to feel heard,” Lee said after her win. Other notable victories included Daniel Cruz as vice president and Priya Narang as treasurer. Faculty advisor Mr. Thompson praised the professionalism of all candidates and encouraged continued involvement in student government. With such strong engagement, the council is hopeful for a productive and inclusive year ahead.

                <p class="news-excerpt">Tensions are rising at Oakwood Academy following an incident where several campaign posters were vandalized just days before the student government elections. Posters for candidate Rachel Adams were reportedly torn down or defaced in multiple school hallways, leading to an official complaint from her campaign team. “This isn’t just disrespectful — it’s undemocratic,” said Adams. School authorities have launched an investigation and reminded students of the code of conduct. Rival candidate Jacob Myers publicly condemned the vandalism and urged all students to maintain fair play. “We’re here to share ideas, not sabotage one another,” he said in a speech. The student council advisor is now implementing stricter rules on poster placement and camera monitoring in high-traffic areas. Despite the setback, Adams remains optimistic: “I’ll continue campaigning with positivity and focus on what matters — making our school better.”</p>

                <p class="news-excerpt">In a first for Westbridge High, students from the computer science club launched a custom-built voting app for the school’s elections this year. The app, named “VoteMate,” allowed students to cast their votes using school-issued tablets or their personal phones. The app featured candidate bios, campaign videos, and a secure login system tied to student IDs. “We wanted to modernize the process and make it accessible to all,” said Liam Park, one of the app’s developers. Teachers praised the initiative for increasing participation and saving paper. Student council advisor Mrs. Ellington said the app boosted voter turnout by nearly 20%. “It made the whole process smoother,” she added. Voters appreciated the simplicity and ability to learn about candidates quickly. The tech team now plans to open-source the app for use in other schools. The election saw newcomer Ava Gonzalez win the presidency, campaigning heavily on digital inclusion and student feedback systems. Her first initiative: expanding access to school Wi-Fi and increasing student tech workshops.

                <p class="news-excerpt">For the first time in Ridgeview Secondary’s history, twin sisters Emma and Emily Walters ran against each other for the position of student body president. The two seniors, known for their leadership in school clubs and sports, drew large crowds to their debates and campaign rallies. Emma focused her campaign on academic reform and mental health resources, while Emily emphasized extracurricular funding and event planning. “We may be twins, but we’ve got very different visions,” joked Emily during their final debate. The race captivated the student body, with many unsure who would come out on top. On election day, Emma narrowly won with 51.2% of the vote. Emily was quick to congratulate her sister, saying, “I’m proud of her — and I’ll still be supporting the student council in every way I can.” Their parents, who attended the results announcement, said they couldn’t be prouder. The election highlighted student engagement, with turnout reaching 90%. Teachers praised the sisters for keeping the competition respectful and inspiring unity among students.</p>

                <p class="news-excerpt">A student reporter at Lincoln Preparatory School has sparked debate after publishing an article revealing discrepancies in campaign funding among student council candidates. Writing for The Lion’s Roar, junior Jamie Chen detailed how some candidates received large donations from student clubs and parents, while others relied on personal savings. The exposé raised questions about fairness and transparency. “We need clear rules on what’s allowed,” Chen wrote. The article prompted immediate responses from the administration and current council members, who pledged to review campaign finance guidelines. Some candidates defended their funding sources, while others welcomed the scrutiny. “This is about equal opportunity,” said candidate Tanya Patel, who had a limited campaign budget. Principal Harding said the school will likely introduce donation caps and mandatory disclosures next year. Chen’s work has been praised as a model of student journalism, and her article has been shared in neighboring schools. Meanwhile, the election continues, with debates now including questions about ethics, equity, and campaign spending.

                <p class="news-excerpt">In an unexpected outcome at Northdale High, sophomore Ethan Monroe won the student body presidency, defeating two seniors and a junior in the running. Known for his role in the environmental club and morning announcements, Monroe built a grassroots campaign focused on sustainability and student wellness. “I didn’t think I’d win,” he admitted. “But I knew I had a message students cared about.” His platform included adding more vegetarian options in the cafeteria, expanding recycling bins, and introducing quiet zones for mental breaks. Students said Monroe’s authenticity and optimism won them over. One senior, who voted for him, commented, “He listens. And he’s got real ideas.” Teachers and students alike were shocked and impressed by the results. Outgoing president Jessica Tran said she looks forward to mentoring Monroe. “He has the energy and vision,” she noted. Monroe has already met with school staff to discuss his first initiatives and is preparing for a school-wide survey to gather student input.

                <p class="news-excerpt">What was supposed to be a civil exchange of ideas turned intense at Brookside High’s student council debate night. Four candidates for president took the stage in front of a packed auditorium, but tensions rose as policies were challenged and personal remarks were exchanged. The clash between Alex Rivera and Natalie James drew the most attention, as they argued over budget priorities. “You’re promising things we can’t afford,” Rivera said. James fired back, “At least I’m trying to do something different.” Moderators had to step in multiple times to steer the conversation back to respectful discourse. Despite the friction, students said the debate helped them understand the candidates’ positions. “It got a little wild, but at least we saw who really cares,” one student remarked. The school’s administration plans to revise the debate format for future years, possibly including time limits and pre-approved question sets. Voting will take place next Monday, and student engagement is expected to remain high.

                <p class="news-excerpt">First-time candidate Malik Johnson is gaining traction in Eastview High’s student council race, bringing forward a message of inclusion and accessibility. A junior transfer student, Malik has quickly made an impression by proposing initiatives that cater to underrepresented groups on campus, including students with disabilities and international students. “I want everyone to feel like they belong,” he said during a campaign rally. His ideas include translated newsletters, more diverse school events, and elevator access awareness. Fellow students have praised Malik’s ability to connect and listen. “He actually asked us what we wanted,” said Sofia Lin, a sophomore. Johnson’s campaign is also notable for its grassroots strategy — he’s avoided flashy posters and instead focused on student meetups and classroom visits. Teachers commend his mature, respectful approach. Election results will be announced this Friday, and many believe Malik has a strong shot at winning. “It’s not about popularity,” he said. “It’s about representation.”</p>

                <p class="news-excerpt">At Bellmont High, a group of seniors staged a peaceful protest after new rules prohibited them from running in the mid-year student council elections. The updated policy, announced just two weeks before the campaign period, restricts candidates to students who will remain enrolled the following academic year — effectively disqualifying most seniors. “It’s unfair and sudden,” said senior Michael Reyes, who had planned to run for president. Over 60 students signed a petition demanding a reversal of the policy. School officials say the change was intended to ensure council continuity. “We want student leaders who can see projects through,” said Vice Principal Denise Lang. But critics argue that the decision limits leadership opportunities and wasn’t communicated clearly. In response to the protest, a town hall meeting was scheduled for next week. Students hope their voices will be heard. “We’re not asking for favoritism,” said Reyes. “Just fairness.” Meanwhile, the election proceeds with eligible juniors and sophomores preparing their campaigns.
